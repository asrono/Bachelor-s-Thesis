Dear reader,
In these documents you can find the matlab code used in my thesis: Non-imaging optics using Laplacian magic windows and Zernike polynomials.

The Main code folder hosts all the major programs and functions I have written. Most relevant is the Results subfolder.
You can find .png files of all the figures in the /Figures folder and the code that generates them in the Plotting code folder.
